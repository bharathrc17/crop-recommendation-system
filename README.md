# Crop Recommendation System 🌾

A machine learning-based web application that recommends the most suitable crop to grow based on soil and environmental conditions.

## 🚀 Features
- Predicts the best crop based on:
  - Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium levels
  - Temperature, Humidity, pH, and Rainfall
- Built using Python and Scikit-learn
- Deployed with Streamlit for real-time predictions

## 🧠 ML Model
- Trained on the Crop Recommendation Dataset
- Algorithms tried: SVM, Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Random Forest
- Final model: **Random Forest** (highest accuracy)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Streamlit
- **Backend**: Python
- **ML Libraries**: scikit-learn, pandas, numpy
- **Deployment**: Streamlit Cloud / Localhost
